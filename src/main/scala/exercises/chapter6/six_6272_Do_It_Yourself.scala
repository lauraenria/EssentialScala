   * Minimum
        Write a method to find the smallest element of a Seq[Int]

   * Unique
        Given Seq(1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4) create the sequence containing each
        number only once. Order is not important, so Seq(1, 2, 4, 3) or
        Seq(4, 3, 2, 1) are equally valid answers. Hint:
        Use contains to check if a sequence contains a value.

   * Reverse
        Write a function that reverses the elements of a sequence.
        Your output does not have to use the same concrete implementation
        as the input. Hint: use foldLeft.

   * Map
        Write map in terms of foldRight.

   * Fold Left
        Write your own implementation of foldLeft that uses foreach and
        mutable state. Remember you can create a mutable variable using
        the var keyword, and assign a new value using =.
        For example
        var mutable = 1
        // mutable: Int = 1
        mutable = 2
        // mutable: Int = 2
   */

  //  List(1, 3, 8).foldLeft(100)(_ - _) == ((100 - 1) - 3) - 8 == 88
  //  List(1, 3, 8).foldRight(100)(_ - _) == 1 - (3 - (8 - 100)) == -94

  /*
    foldLeft:

   * initial value has to be passed

    reduceLeft:

   * takes first element of the collection as initial value
   * throws exception if collection is empty

    Here is the signature of foldLeft (could also have been foldRight for the point I'm going to make):

def foldLeft [B] (z: B)(f: (B, A) => B): B
And here is the signature of reduceLeft (again the direction doesn't matter here)

def reduceLeft [B >: A] (f: (B, A) => B): B
These two look very similar and thus caused the confusion.
reduceLeft is a special case of foldLeft
(which by the way means that you sometimes can express the same thing by using either of them).

When you call reduceLeft say on a List[Int]
it will literally reduce the whole list of integers into a single value,
which is going to be of type Int (or a supertype of Int, hence [B >: A]).

When you call foldLeft say on a List[Int] it will fold the whole list
(imagine rolling a piece of paper) into a single value,
but this value doesn't have to be even related to Int (hence [B]).

    Steps
    1. check if empty
    2. order the seq
    3. return min
