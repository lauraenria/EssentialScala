class Q_4703_Music {
  /*
  In the JSON exercise there was a well defined specifica on to model. In this
  exercise we want to work on modelling skills given a rather fuzzy specifica on.
  The goal is to model music. You can choose to interpret this how you want,
  making your model as simple or complex as you like. The cri cal thing is to be
  able to jus fy the decisions you made, and to understand the limits of your
  model.
  You might find it easiest to use the BNF nota on, introduced in the JSON
  exercise, to write down your model.
