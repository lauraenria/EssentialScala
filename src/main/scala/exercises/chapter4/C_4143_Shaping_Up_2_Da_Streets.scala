    Book: Essential Scala Chapter 4
    Exercise 4.1.4.3 Shaping Up 2 (Da Streets)
    The solution from the last exercise delivered three dis nct types of shape.
    However, it doesn’t model the relationships between the three correctly. A
    Square isn’t just a Shape —it’s also a type of Rectangle where the width and
    height are the same.
    Refactor the solution to the last exercise so that Square and Rectangle are
    subtypes of a common type Rectangular .
    Tip: A trait can extend another trait.
