/*
For the base case we should generally return the identity
The identity is an element that doesnâ€™t change the result. E.g. 0 for addition

For the recursive case, assume the recursion will return the correct result
and work out what you need to add to get the correct answer


We can apply the same structural recursion patterns to process a recursive
algebraic data type. The only wrinkle is that we must make a recursive call
when the data definition is recursion.

Recursive Algebraic Data Types Pattern

Cases that are not recursive are known as base cases.
